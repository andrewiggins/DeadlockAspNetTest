<p>
    This demo calls a method that actually doesn't perform any actual asynchronous operations and 
    so it renders correctly even though it uses <code>GetAwaiter().GetResult()</code>. There is no deadlock here
    because there is no asynchronous operation that attempts to schedule a callback.
